# iPhone Recreation Site

This project is a recreation of the iPhone's UI/UX using [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), built as part of my practice in mastering web animations. The site mimics the look and feel of the iPhone's home screen and other interactions. This project serves as a personal learning experience to enhance animation skills.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Practice with GSAP and recreate the iPhone UI with smooth animations.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Vite

## Features

- Fully animated iPhone home screen recreation.
- Smooth icon transitions and animations using GSAP.
- Interactivity mimicking real iPhone behavior (e.g., app opening animations, screen swipes).
